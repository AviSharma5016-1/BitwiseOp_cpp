## ✅ Experiment 4A: Bitwise Operators

**AIM:**
To write a C++ program demonstrating the use of bitwise operators: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift.

**THEORY:**
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations directly on the binary representations of integers:

* `&` (AND): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
* `|` (OR): Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1.
* `^` (XOR): Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the two bits is 1.
* `~` (NOT): Inverts all bits.
* `<<` (Left Shift): Shifts bits to the left, effectively multiplying by 2ⁿ.
* `>>` (Right Shift): Shifts bits to the right, dividing by 2ⁿ (ignores remainder).

Example:
For `a = 7 (0111)` and `b = 8 (1000)`, the various bitwise results illustrate how binary manipulation can yield different integer values.

**CONCLUSION:**
The program successfully demonstrated all common bitwise operations. This experiment improved understanding of how data is stored and manipulated at the binary level — which is essential in low-level programming, optimization, and embedded systems.

## ✅ Experiment 4B: Toggle a Specific Bit in an Integer

**AIM:**
To write a C++ program that toggles a specific bit of an integer entered by the user.

**THEORY:**
To toggle (flip) a specific bit in an integer:

* Use the XOR (`^`) operator with a mask having a 1 at the desired position.
* The mask is created by shifting `1` left by `(position - 1)` places.

Formula:

```cpp
toggled = number ^ (1 << (position - 1));
```

This approach uses bit manipulation to change a 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 without affecting other bits.

**CONCLUSION:**
The program worked accurately and efficiently toggled the specified bit in the input number. This experiment demonstrated how powerful and precise bit-level operations can be when dealing with low-level data manipulation and memory-efficient coding techniques.
